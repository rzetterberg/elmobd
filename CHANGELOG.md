# Changelog

## [0.6.1] - 2020-03-03
### Fixed 
- Some slow obd-ii interfaces seems to timeout with a "UNABLE TO CONNECT" answer. Retrying after 5 seconds seems to fix the problem

## [0.6.0] - 2019-03-20

### Fixed 
- issue #18 - commands expect one byte as response - mocked device returned three bytes
- device identyfication issue - some device identified itself in second line of response 

### Added
- `NewDistSinceDTCClear` command (0x31) - distance since last DTC clear
- mocked responses for Fuel (0x2F), Speed (0x0D)

## [0.5.1] - 2018-08-15

### Changed
- `CheckSupportedCommands` now ignores parts after part 1 that fails

## [0.5.0] - 2018-08-13

### Added
- Command for retrieving fuel quantity

## [0.4.0] - 2018-06-23

### Added
- Command for checking if MIL is on, and amount of DTCs flagged

## [0.3.0] - 2018-01-21

### Changed
- Sends expected data lines with each OBD command to speed up communication

## [0.2.2] - 2017-12-25

### Fixed
- "SEARCHING..." responses not being handled

## [0.2.1] - 2017-12-10

### Added
- Godocs for functions and types
- Separate examples
- Integration tests

## [0.2.0] - 2017-10-06

### Added
- More predefined OBD commands for getting:
  - Short term fuel trim bank 1
  - Long term fuel trim bank 1
  - Short term fuel trim bank 2
  - Long term fuel trim bank 2
  - OBD standards vehicle conforms to

  - Supported PIDs 61-80
  - Supported PIDs 81-A0

### Changed
- More clear handling of results and conversions

## [0.1.0] - 2017-09-24

### Added
- Connecting to the device
- Writing data to the device
- Reading data from the device
- Automatically setting end protocol
- Checking supported OBD commands
- Getting version of device
- Type safe OBD command usage API
- Predefined OBD sensor commands for getting:
  - Engine load
  - Coolant temperature
  - Fuel pressure
  - Intake manifold pressure
  - Engine RPM
  - Vehicle speed
  - Timing advance
  - MAF air flow rate
  - Throttle position
- Getting all supported OBD sensor data for the current car
- Exposing Prometheus metrics over HTTP

Reading sensor data from my Lexus IS200 -04 was fairly slow. At worst it took
almost ~2.5 seconds, and at best it took ~1.7 seconds:

This could probably be sped up if we tell the ELM327 device how many data lines
to receive, instead of waiting the default 200 ms per OBD command. See ELM327
data sheet for details, search for "data lines", or similar.
